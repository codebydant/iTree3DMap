# 3D Mapping of individual tree with OpenMVG-PMVS2

This is a reference implementation of a Structure-from-Motion pipeline in OpenCV, following the work of Roy Shilkrot at SfM-Toy-Library. https://github.com/royshil/SfM-Toy-Library

*Note:* This is not a complete and robust SfM pipeline implementation. The purpose of this code is to do a 3D reconstruction of a tree and get dendrometry estimation. 

----------------------
## Example

<img src="./imgs/tree_house.jpg" align="center" height="400" width="1600"><br>

A simple incremental SFM pipeline for 3D reconstruction of a tree with bundle adjustment. 
* Incremental SFM
* Bundle Adjustment - Ceres solver
* Segmentation - PCL color based growing segmentation
* Densify cloud - PMVS2 

### Resources

* Homepage: <http://opencv.org>
* Docs: <http://docs.opencv.org/master/>

## Build 

To build use CMake minimum required 3.5.1 : https://github.com/Kitware/CMake

### Prerequisite
- OpenCV 3.4.1: https://github.com/opencv
- ROS Kinetic: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu

### How to make
* Download the src code: git@github.com:danielTobon43/perc_robotic_system3d.git and Unpack .zip
* Copy the package to ROS workspace/src
* Compile with catkin

	*cd ~/catkin_ws
	*catkin_make
 	 
### Test
	cd ~/catkin_ws
	source devel/setup.bash
	roscore
	rosrun perc_robotic_system3d perc_robotic_system3d		

*Note:*
If OpenCV are not install. just compiled. pleas set the path to the current build directory in CMakeList.txt file.
